UNK is a five protein complex conserved from yeast to humans involved in linking mrna transcription and export . the UNK 2 subunit of UNK is also a component of the centrosome and is additionally involved in a distinctly different process of nuclear protein export . while UNK 2 is a known multifunctional protein the roles of other human UNK complex proteins other than mrna export are not known . in this study we found that human UNK member UNK but not UNK is involved in some of the same cellular processes as those of UNK 2 apart from the classical UNK function . UNK is present at the centrosome in a subset of hela cells and this localization is UNK 2 dependent . furthermore the presence of UNK at the centrosome is prevalent throughout the cell cycle as determined by UNK with cyclins e a and b . UNK but not UNK is also involved in protein export . surprisingly sirna knockdown of UNK delayed the rate of nuclear protein export a mechanism distinct from the effects of UNK 2 which when knocked down inhibits export . finally we showed that UNK of UNK 2 and UNK leads to

cell adhesion on substrates is accompanied by significant changes in shape and cytoskeleton organization which affect subsequent cellular and tissue responses determining the longterm success of an implant . alterations in osteoblast stiffness upon adhesion on orthopaedic implants with different surface chemical composition and topography are thus of central interest in the field of bone implant research . this work aimed to study the mechanical response of osteoblasts upon adhesion on chitosancoated glass surfaces and to investigate possible correlations with the level of adhesion spreading and cytoskeleton reorganization . using the micropipette aspiration technique the osteoblast elastic modulus was found higher on chitosancoated than on uncoated control substrates and it was found to increase in the course of spreading for both substrates . the cellsurface contact area was measured throughout several time points of adhesion to quantify cell spreading kinetics . significant differences were found between chitosan and control surfaces regarding the response of cell spreading while both groups displayed a sigmoidal UNK behavior with an initially elevated spreading rate which stabilizes in the second hour of attachment . actin filament structural changes were confirmed after observation with confocal microscope . biomaterial surface modification can enhance osteoblast mechanical response and

we report various types of pathways emerging in the course of freezing into a high pressure ice vii by largescale molecular dynamics md simulations at 10 gpa 425 k . some trajectories showed an apparently stepwise transition via the unique metastable phase in accordance with UNK step rule . the metastable structure was identified as one of the UNK closepacked structures having the nature of a rotator phase plastic phase . the unit cell consists of 21 water molecules that has not yet been reported by simulation or by experiments . structure analysis of numerous trajectories reveals that the nucleation of ice vii easily occurs at the grain boundaries of the metastable embryos known as UNK transformation in line with UNK step rule . the size of the grain boundaries is thus responsible for the lifetime of the metastable phase . on the other hand once the embryo of ice vii appears prior to that of the metastable phase in liquid direct transition to ice vii takes place . we also show that the plastic behavior of the metastable phase is not uniform but is sensitive to the interaction strength of adjacent molecules and the local structure thus we call

aging is wellknown an inevitable process that is influenced by genetic lifestyle and environmental factors . however the exact mechanisms underlying the aging process are not well understood . increasing evidence shows that aging is highly associated with chronic increase in reactive oxygen species ros accumulation of a lowgrade proinflammatory phenotype and reduction in agerelated autophagy suggesting that these factors may play important roles in promoting aging . indeed reduction of ros and lowgrade inflammation and promotion of autophagy by calorie restriction or other dietary manipulation can extend lifespan in a wide spectrum of model organisms . interestingly recent studies show that some UNK small molecules also called phytochemicals can extend lifespan in various animal species . in this paper we review several recently identified potential antiaging phytochemicals that have been studied in cells animals and humans and further highlight the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying the antiaging actions by these molecules .

there is an unmet clinical need to increase lung transplant successes patient satisfaction and to improve mortality rates . we offer the development of a UNK solution that will reduce the incidence of lung ischemic reperfusion injury iri leading to graft organ failure through the successful ex vivo treatment of the lung prior to transplantation . the innovation is in the integrated application of our novel porous silicon psi microparticles carrying adenoassociated virus aav nanoparticles and the use of our ex vivo lung UNK system for the modulation of proinflammatory cytokines initiated by ischemic pulmonary conditions prior to organ transplant that often lead to complications . gene delivery of antiinflammatory agents to combat the inflammatory cascade may be a promising approach to prevent iri following lung transplantation . the rationale for the device is that the microparticle will deliver a large payload of virus to cells and serve to protect the aav from immune recognition . the UNK hybrid device was tested both in vitro on cell monolayers and ex vivo using either porcine venous tissue or a pig lung transplantation model which recapitulates pulmonary iri that occurs clinically posttransplantation . remarkably loading aav vectors into psi microparticles increases gene

although inhibition of the insulinlike growth factor igf signaling pathway was expected to eliminate a key resistance mechanism for egf receptor UNK cancers the effectiveness of igfi receptor igfir inhibitors in clinical trials has been limited . a multiplicity of survival mechanisms are available to cancer cells . both igfir and the erbb3 receptor activate the pi3kaktmtor axis but erbb3 has only recently been pursued as a therapeutic target . we show that coactivation of the erbb3 pathway is prevalent in a majority of cell lines responsive to igf ligands and antagonizes UNK growth inhibition . blockade of the redundant igfir and erbb3 survival pathways and downstream resistance mechanisms was achieved with UNK a tetravalent bispecific antibody antagonist of igfir and erbb3 . UNK potency was superior to monospecific and combination antibody therapies and was insensitive to variation in the ratio of igfir and erbb3 receptors . UNK enhanced the biologic impact of receptor inhibition in vivo as a monotherapy and in combination with the mtor inhibitor everolimus gemcitabine or docetaxel through blockade of igfir and erbb3 signaling and prevention of pi3kaktmtor network adaptation .

the genetic background associated with the dysregulation of orthostatic blood pressure remains poorly understood . the sympathetic nervous system plays a pivotal role in the regulation of blood pressure as well as in response to positional changes . the essential role of adrenergic receptors in the sympathetic nervous system prompted us to hypothesize that common genetic variants of the α2adrenergic receptor might contribute to the dysregulation of orthostatic blood pressure in general populations . this study is to explore the association between the polymorphisms of the α2adrenergic receptor genes and the occurrence of orthostatic hypotension in chinese populations .
